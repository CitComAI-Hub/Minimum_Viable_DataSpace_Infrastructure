# FIWARE Data Space (FDS) Ecosystem

The FIWARE Data Space (FDS) is a set of components that allow the creation of a data space. The data space is a secure and trusted environment where data providers and consumers can exchange data in a secure and trusted way.

In the minimal version of the data space, we have the following components:

- **FIWARE Data Space Trust Anchor**: The trust anchor is the entity that manages the issuers and credentials for all participants in the data space.

- **FIWARE Data Space Connector (Provider/Consumer)**: The connector is the entity that provides and consumes data from the data space. The connector can be a provider, a consumer, or both. In this deployment, we use the latest version (2.x) of the [FIWARE Data Space Connector](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector).

## Trust Anchor (Operator)

FIWARE has developed a Trust Anchor Operator as a Helm chart, that manages issuers and credentials for all participants in the data space. 

| Module       | Version | Repository | Chart code |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| trust-anchor | 0.2.0   | `https://fiware.github.io/data-space-connector/` | [GitHub](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector/tree/main/charts/trust-anchor) |

## FDS Connector

The FIWARE Data Space (FDS) Connector is a Helm chart that allows the deployment of a connector in the data space. Depending on the configuration, the connector can be: **provider/consumer** or **consumer**.

| Module               | Version | Repository | Chart code |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| data-space-connector | 7.17.0  | `https://fiware.github.io/data-space-connector/` | [GitHub](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector/tree/main/charts/data-space-connector) |

### Consumer

The consumer connector is an entity that only consumes data from the data space.

More [info](https://github.com/FIWARE/data-space-connector/blob/main/doc/deployment-integration/local-deployment/LOCAL.MD#the-data-consumer).

The following diagram shows the main blocks of the architecture of the consumer connector:

### Provider/Consumer

The provider/consumer connector is an entity that provides and consumes data from the data space. This component is composed of four main blocks:

1. **Data Services**: In this example we use Scorpio Broker (NGSI-LD Context Broker).
2. **Authentication**: VCVerifier, CredentialsConfigService, TrustedIssuersList.
3. **Authorization**: Gateway (APISIX), Open Policy Agent, ODRL-PAP.
4. **Value Creation**: TMForum API, Contract Management.
